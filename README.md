# Google Translate with Shortcut

This is for use with Mac OSX.
 
It is really difficult to translate messages in applications other than chrome as you will need to copy each message, move to browser and translate it.

To make life easy with translation, I created a automator script which translates the selected text to english without worrying about flooding slack if you use zapier to translate stuff. I was inspired by this [article](https://filipmolcik.com/right-click-to-translate-with-google-translator/).
